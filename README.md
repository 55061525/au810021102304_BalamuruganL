Heart Disease Prediction - You are tasked to perform Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression. The World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who have a good chance of being affected by CVD.

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("heart_disease_data.csv")

# Data preprocessing
# Assuming data preprocessing steps have been done here (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)

# Splitting the data into features and target variable
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Creating and training the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Making predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Model evaluation
